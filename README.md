# IPWeek6-Core
# Supervised Learning with Exploratory Data Analysis
# Defining the Question
You have been recruited as a football analyst in a company - Mchezopesa Ltd and tasked to accomplish the task below.A prediction result of a game between team 1 and team 2, based on who's home and who's away, and on whether or not the game is friendly (include rank in your training). You have two possible approaches (polynomial and logistic approaches) given the datasets that will be provided

# a) Specifying the Question
Mchezo pesa is a football analyst company in East Africa. Mchezo-Pesa would like to predict the result of a game based whether the teams playing are in their home country or not and whether the game is friendly or not.

# b) Defining the metrics for success
This project will be successful when: 
1)We accurately predict the winning team based on the two factors:

a)Home team or away team

b)The type of tournament

2)The model achieves atleast 80% accuracy

3)Have the lowest RMSE score possible

# c) Understanding the context
You have been recruited as a football analyst in a company - Mchezopesa Ltd and tasked to accomplish the task below.Predict the result of a game between team 1 and team 2, based on who's home and who's away, and on whether or not the game is friendly (include rank in your training).

# d) Recording the Experimental Design
1.reading in the datasets.

2. checking the data for duplicates and missinng data.

3. dropping of duplicates and removal filling in of missing data values with zero.

4. Finding and dealing with outliers, anomalies, and missing data within the dataset.

5. Performing of EDA recording of observations.

6. Implementing the solution by performing the respective analysis i.e. factor analysis, principal component analysis, and discriminant analysis.

7. Perform any necessary feature engineering

8. Check of multicollinearity

9. Start building the model, Cross-validate the model

10. Compute RMSE

11. Create residual plots for your models, and assess their heteroscedasticity using Bartlettâ€™s test

12. Perform appropriate regressions on the data including your justification

13. Challenge your solution by providing insights on how you can make improvements.

# e) Relevance of the data
The data that was used for survey was obtained from an open datasource. This data is an aggregation by day of the number of goals scored and rankings of countries in the men's FIFA team. With it's a model that determines which team gets to be ranked where and how according to the years and goals.
